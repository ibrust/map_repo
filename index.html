            <div class="paragraph">The inspiration for this project—making a map of the Civil War’s <em>guerrilla</em> violence, as opposed to its battlefield violence—came about at West Virginia University (WVU) and the National Park Service from 2011-2013. I worked as a Park Ranger in the summer between my two years at WVU. At the parks, we started off every battlefield tour in front of a map, because it’s the only way you can make sense of such violence. (Imagine a five-year-old dressed up in a Confederate uniform in a crowd of fifty people raising their hand and asking why soldiers who didn’t know one another tried to fill each other up with bullets. Yes, that happened to me while giving a tour of the Battle of Fredericksburg.) The best way to answer that question was to explain that almost 200,000 strangers tried to kill each other because of the railroad on the map: it led straight to Richmond, Virginia—the Confederate capital. If the Union army could take that railroad, they could possibly end the war. As it turned out, they couldn’t; instead, tens of thousands of Federal troops assaulted an entrenched Confederate line, resulting in one of the war’s most lop-sided battles.  </div><img src="images/Author_02_ParkRanger.jpg" alt="Me in uniform.

            <div class="paragraph-2">After work, I read up on the guerrilla war literature that would form the bibliography of my master’s thesis at WVU. This was a very different war from the one I interpreted for park visitors every day, one devoid of honor, civility, and order, but replete with savagery, nihilism, and terror. However, a glaring hole existed in this literature: there were no maps. The most powerful tool at my disposal to make sense of violence on America’s battlefields was completely missing from historians’ analyses of guerrilla warfare in the Civil War. To be sure, historians <em>couldn’t </em>make a map of guerrilla war until the advent of digital mapping techniques—the guerrilla war’s size and scope was too big for traditional mapmakers. Guerrillas operated on any given day, in any given space, throughout the Confederacy. That covers 1,500 days and 770,400 square miles (and doesn’t even include the guerrilla-style violence in the Missouri-Kansas border war throughout the late 1850s <em>or </em>the guerrilla-style violence enacted by paramilitary groups like the Ku Klux Klan throughout Reconstruction).</div>

On the ground, we see savagery—thousands of troops running into a slaughter at Fredericksburg.From a bird’s-eye-view, we see order and logic—Robert E. Lee’s legendary strategy and tactics at the same battle. Because historians never looked at guerrilla war with a bird’s-eye-view, all they saw was savagery.

            <div class="paragraph-2 section-top">I set out to view guerrilla war from a bird’s-eye-view by using geographers’ preferred spatial analysis system: ArcGIS. This software enabled me to map multiple layers of data over vast swaths of space and time <em>and </em>run hundreds of tools that illuminated patterns within that data. The essence of guerrilla warfare, and therefore the content of these maps, consists of three main groups: instances of guerrilla violence, the Union army’s location, and southern-sympathizing and guerrilla-aiding households (referred to collectively as guerrillas&#x27; domestic supply line). By discovering <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> instances of guerrilla violence occurred in relation to the southern-sympathizing civilians and Union soldiers present in the landscape, we can actually see the mutual locations where guerrilla warfare’s participants operated. It was in this symbiotic space that guerrillas and Union troops continuously reinvented their war-making policies, practices, and the justifications for both.<br></div>

            <div class="paragraph chapter-top">My interpretation of these spatial relationships led to four key conclusions. First, <em>temporary</em> Union occupation incited guerrilla violence. Guerrillas frequently operated in locations previously occupied by small outfits of Union troops (typically cavalry units). Furthermore, guerrillas targeted weak spots in Union war industries—small garrisons, railroads, telegraph lines, and supply trains—and gray areas within official Union combatants—militias, Home Guards, and furloughed soldiers. </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="w-row">
          <div class="w-col w-col-4">
            <blockquote class="block-quote mobile">Not only did guerrilla violence influence the conventional war’s conduct... it created a unique household war zone that swallowed any person—commander, soldier, vigilante, guerrilla, or citizen—living in occupied territory.</blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="column-5 w-col w-col-8">
            <div class="paragraph-2">Second, guerrilla violence relied on a web of rebel households. Guerrillas&#x27; “domestic supply line” enabled them to operate by functioning as quartermaster, supply line, and command and control center. In essence, these first two arguments inject order and logic into guerrillas’ violence. They also tack closer to interpretations of guerrilla war espoused by historians outside the American Civil War field.<br><br>Third, because Union occupiers rarely killed guerrillas and increasingly turned to attacking guerrillas&#x27; domestic supply line instead, the home front and conventional battlefield were not separate entities but a single, irregular war zone. Despite official policy (historians typically cite the restraints present in Francis Lieber’s General Order No. 100—the instructions for Union field armies), the Union army synthesized its regular and irregular strategies in response to guerrilla warfare. Not only did guerrilla violence influence the conventional war’s conduct, as Daniel Sutherland argues, it created a unique household war zone that swallowed any person—commander, soldier, vigilante, guerrilla, or citizen—living in occupied territory.<br>‍<br>Last, despite all of these patterns, guerrillas still utilized terrorism. They often targeted victims at random and employed tactics—ambushes, posthumous mutilation, retreats—deemed inhumane and cowardly by typical nineteenth-century standards. American Civil War historians’ previous conclusions about guerrillas are not wrong, they’re just unbalanced. This project is entitled <em>Of Methods and Madness</em> as a nod to the scholarly giants whose shoulders my work stands upon. <br><br>For detailed descriptions of evidence leading to these conclusions from Missouri and Kentucky, please see previous versions of the project located in <em>Project History.</em> <br><br>As the project’s current form uses data from the entire war (and not just Missouri and Kentucky—the states explored in my dissertation), I’ll risk extrapolating my conclusions to our conceptions of war, in general. To do so, I can’t help but borrow from two military theorists whose opposing viewpoints dominated global conceptions of war in the nineteenth century: Carl von Clausewitz and Antoine-Henri Jomini. Jomini condemned guerrilla war as uncivilized and “so terrible that, for the sake of humanity, we ought to hope never to see it.” On the other hand, Clausewitz accepted guerrilla war as part of the human condition. He believed that Jomini’s idea of “civilized” warfare was only “war on paper”—a veil to cover up the fact that war can never be civilized; it is not a rational act between governments and it cannot be conducted free from emotion, passion, and hostility. “Real war” was different, it was “an act of force to compel our adversary to do our will.” Clausewitz acknowledged that ruthless brutality was the quickest way to achieve this end. Guerrilla war, then, was an unfortunate “intensification” of violence, but an inevitable part of war, nonetheless<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  <br><br><em>Of Methods and Madness</em> maps guerrilla war in the hopes that if scholars ask precisely where and when guerrilla violence occurred, they can get closer to the answer of why it occurred, getting closer to understanding its essential nature. The project&#x27;s findings—patterns between guerrillas and Union soldiers and a reinforcement of the necessary role of domestic spaces—serve to demythologize the interpretation of the Civil War as a limited, conventional one between formal armies and instead tack closer to Clausewitz&#x27;s conception of &quot;real war.&quot; This scholarship forces us to answer to the chaos and brutality which characterized America’s Civil War in light of today’s wars. If we can better understand how the Civil War&#x27;s guerrilla conflict became such hell, perhaps we can better understand war in all its hellish forms, whether it took place in the bush of Missouri, the trenches at Spotsylvania Courthouse, the beaches at Normandy, the jungles of Vietnam, or the mountains of Afghanistan.</div>

            <div class="paragraph-2">This particular version of <em>OMAM </em>draws its data from the War Department’s <em>Official Records of the War of the Rebellion </em>(<em>OR</em>), which comprises what historian Yael Sternhell called “the basis for what we know about the Civil War.” This source is so robust—128 volumes of primary evidence at roughly 900 pages per volume—that it generates data for every layer on the map: guerrilla violence, Union army movement, and guerrillas’ domestic supply line. <br>‍<br>In 2016, Sternhell published a brilliant article in the <em>Journal of American History</em> that detailed the <em>OR</em>’s collection and preservation processes, along with its inadequacies. A summary of that work will suffice here. Most importantly, Sternhell discovered that the <em>OR</em>’s creation took place in the context of sectional reconciliation. In fact, the “Confederacy’s leadership was instrumental in correcting, fact checking, and proofreading the documents that would make up the <em>OR.” </em>Not surprisingly, “ex-Confederates were first and foremost concerned with propagating their version of the facts” (as were the northerners involved in the project). As a result, the evidence included in the <em>OR </em>“offered historians the documentary basis for narratives that gave both sides an equal voice and made battlefield drama the central interest of Civil War history. It enabled the comforting, reunionist histories that marginalized the importance of emancipation and generally ignored the role of African Americans.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><br>‍<br>Therefore, at its heart, this project’s current version leaves a gaping hole in the historiography: the role of race in the Civil War’s guerrilla conflict. It is my hope that in laying this deficiency bare, other scholars will bear its torch as soon as possible. </div>

            <div class="paragraph-2">This data illustrates the Union army’s spatial location throughout the war (representing the points army regiments visited, but not the spaces over which they travelled). The source’s transformation, from actual boots on the ground to a written reference work to points on a map, spans over 150 years.<br> <br>One set of those boots belonged to Frederick H. Dyer, who ran away from school to join the army at age fourteen. He served as a drummer boy in the 7th Connecticut, “and there is nothing in Dyer’s record to suggest that he was anything but a solid character and a dutiful soldier.” Dyer survived the war and worked as a “commercial traveler” when not engaged in his duties as Commander of the Pennsylvania Department of the Grand Army of the Republic. Dyer took seriously the latter position, compiling regimental histories at each meeting—from veterans and historical archives—and obsessing over their completeness and correctness. One journalist claimed that it “used to be a favorite trick of his to stand up in an audience of 500 to 1,000 old soldiers and challenge any man to name a regiment whose record of service he could not give.” He kept at it for almost forty years until enough veterans—General Sherman included—convinced him that the war’s importance necessitated a compendium of regimental histories, violent engagements, casualties, and officer commands, and that Dyer was the only man for the job. It seems those veterans were right, for Dyer’s work ethic in completing such a compilation is almost beyond words: &quot;He stuck to his work with a dogged determination that meant a sort of heroism that not many understand. For five years he kept at his desk leaving it only to eat a little and to sleep a little. He was at it before breakfast, he kept at it until after midnight. He isolated himself in his room for weeks at a stretch. … Seven times he went over his list of battles to make sure that nothing had been omitted and that no mistakes had been made in dates, that the list of killed had been properly reported and each time this revision took him seven months.&quot; <br><br>The result defies comparison. Dyer’s Compendium of the War of the Rebellion consists of “thousands of sheets, millions of words, involving the examination of 10,000,000 names and dates, every line of it prepared by [him] … without the aid of a secretary or even a stenographer.” <em>Of Methods and Madness</em> consults two of its three volumes, Volume I: Battles and Volume III: Regimental Histories. Despite the impossibility of perfecting such a reference work, immediate veteran reviews praised its accuracy and today’s archivists and historians agree on its “general reliability.” In fact, over a century after its publication, Dyer’s Compendium remains the most comprehensive collection of Union regimental histories to include spatiotemporal information.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><br><br>In the 1980s, Gregory Crane and the Tufts University Perseus Digital Library digitized all three volumes of Dyer’s Compendium.

            <div class="paragraph-2">Each stage of this source’s data transformation contains unique limitations. First, Dyer’s Compendium contains known and unknown errors. Dyer worked at the regimental level and did not include many company-level movements in his work. This poses a problem as the Union military sent many companies on search-and-destroy missions specifically targeting guerrillas. Similarly, many Union “detectives”—who were given small squads of troops and extreme leeway in breaking official policy toward civilians—investigated guerrillas and their supporters; Dyer did not document such activities. Dyer drew much of his evidence from the <em>OR</em>, meaning any errors, omissions, or biases in that source transmitted to his <em>Compendium</em>. Additionally, a large amount of guerrilla violence enacted against civilians actually targeted members of local Unionist militias. Dyer did not account for many civilian militias. This omission enhances the image of guerrilla violence as anarchic by enabling historians to characterize guerrillas’ targets as innocent civilians instead of proactive extensions of the Union army (Unionist militias often received arms from the army and contained former soldiers and/or soldiers’ family members). <br>‍<br>Concerning terminology, Dyer used 117 terms to describe the Union army’s movements (for example, ‘about,’ ‘outpost duty,’ ‘transferred,’ or ‘marched’) and often used multiple terms to describe the same line of data (for example, ‘repulsing’ an attack before ‘marching’ somewhere nearby and performing ‘guard duty’). Furthermore, Dyer never defined his terminology (for example, explaining the differences between a scout, expedition, or reconnaissance mission). Lastly, Dyer was a Union veteran and Union subjectivity must be taken into account.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup><br><br>Second, the Perseus Digital Library introduced errors during digitization. Digitizing a textual document involves scanning the document into a computer and using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to convert the scanned image of text into text itself. This software is imperfect; misspellings and omissions inevitably occur. The Perseus Digital Library’s Managing Editor, Lisa M. Cerrato, stated that the “OCR clean up error quality was contracted at 98.5%,” although the Library has not checked the actual output to ensure that 98.5% of Dyer’s text was correctly digitized. Additionally, Perseus identified which words in the digitized text portrayed spatial information by tagging “placenames” (for example, tagging the placename “Tuscumbia, Alabama” in the sentence “Expedition toward Tuscumbia, Ala., December 9-24”). Perseus did not tag every placename in Dyer’s text. For example, Perseus did not tag regions (such as “North Alabama”) or features of the built environment (such as “Cobb’s Mill” or “Brown’s Ferry”). Again, the Perseus Library has not checked the digitized text to calculate a percent error of its tagging process (or to discover how many locations are missing).<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></div>

            <div class="paragraph-2">Third, “Visualizing Emancipation” introduced errors during its geotagging process. This process works by using an algorithm to match latitude and longitude coordinates with the placenames Perseus tagged in Dyer’s text. To do this, the algorithm searches an online database of placename coordinates, in this case, the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names<sup>®</sup> Online, which contains 4,100,000 placenames and their associated latitude and longitude. The automated geotagging process could not identify every location in Dyer’s Compendium for multiple reasons. First, the Getty Thesaurus does not catalogue every location in Dyer’s Compendium; this is especially true for historical locations. For example, the 80th Illinois Infantry fought at “Blount’s plantation,” but Getty does not contain coordinates for Blount’s plantation. Second, some placenames have multiple locations, such as “Springfield.” If Dyer did not list a state or county, the algorithm does not know which “Springfield” to choose (or it may choose the wrong one). Lastly, Getty uses the coordinates of water feature’s starting point. If Dyer mentioned the “Mississippi River” when describing General Grant’s approach to Vicksburg, Mississippi, the geotagging process may have mistakenly identified Grant’s approach at the Mississippi River’s starting point in northern Minnesota. “Visualizing Emancipation” notes that their map of Union army “locations should be regarded as approximations subject to a number of caveats” (described above) but does not disclose an error quality percentage. Despite these shortcomings, “Visualizing Emancipation” remains the very best map of the Union army’s wartime movements—no other map comes close in breadth or accuracy. The dataset contains 42,109 locations, only eighty-eight of which do not have latitude and longitude coordinates. I uploaded the dataset into <em>Of Methods and Madness</em> as is, without attempting to correct any inaccurate tagging or geotagging errors. Only a project dedicated to that task could do so properly.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></div>

The original source of consulted NHGIS data is the U.S. Census. U.S. Marshals conducted the 1860 census and sought to record accurate information as census data determined each state’s number of Congressional representatives. Still, the census ultimately relied on humans collecting self-reported data. A tired marshal may have skipped certain neighborhoods and Americans may have disclosed vague or inaccurate answers. There is no way to calculate a percent error for the U.S. Census. County borders—drawn by U.S. geological survey teams—are much more reliable, although these borders changed during the war and OMAM does not account for such changes.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup><br><br>UNL’s process of “digitizing historical maps and capturing the [railroad] line data from them resulted in wide variation and inaccuracies.” Historical maps “often contained never completed roads and projected lines and towns.” Consequently, UNL cross-referenced data from multiple source materials. However, these were usually drawn at different scales, making their integration problematic. To counter these difficulties, the research team created a five-step quality control process to ensure the most accurate representation of railroad lines possible. In addition, OMAM does not account for changes in the railroad system during the war—the miles of new track continually laid by railroad companies or both armies’ destruction of railroads for logistical purposes. (Notably, these challenges explain why OMAM’s map does not contain road systems. Although it would be possible to build a map of Civil War road systems from sources such as The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War, only a separate research project solely focused on building such a map could do so accurately.)<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></div>

            <div class="paragraph-2">Accurate representation of nineteenth-century river systems suffers from both natural and man-made changes to waterways over time. Floods, erosion, damming, and straightening all altered the course of rivers since the Civil War. Jeremy Atack’s navigable river system pays particular attention to historical political boundaries—usually influenced by natural barriers such as waterways—and rivers regularly navigated by steamboats throughout the nineteenth century. Atack’s river lines most likely depict waterways utilized by the Union and Confederate militaries. I consulted Natural Earth’s river data only when necessary (Natural Earth’s data represents a simplified and modern version of America’s river systems).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup><br></div>

            <div class="paragraph chapter-top">This section describes the datafication processes used in <em>OMAM</em>—transforming primary source material into database categories and subsequent map symbology. This procedure varied for each of the three elements depicted on <em>OMAM</em>’s digital map (the Union army, instances of guerrilla violence, and guerrillas’ domestic supply line). Most important in these descriptions are the decisions I made when converting primary source text to coded information in databases. Marrying historical source’s diverse psychological motives, controversial definitions, cryptic messages, and incomplete evidence with computer software’s calculated and rigid logic can feel like fitting a square peg in a round hole. Consequently, the historian who quantifies, measures, and maps subjective evidence introduces a new layer of human imperfection with each decision they make; <em>how </em>I datafied evidence and the information I chose to map versus the information I left unmapped says something about my own biases and desires. In disclosing these decisions, I hope to improve upon not only our interpretation of guerrilla warfare, but also our methods for collecting, preserving, and analyzing the past.<br></div>

More frequently, documents simply mentioned the county in which guerrillas operated (categorized by ‘county’ along with ‘county_lat’ and ‘county_long’). Other times, documents only described a region or mentioned a state (categorized by ‘place_descriptor’ and ‘state’). With the expertise of GeoScience and Computer Science students at Middle Tennessee State University, we devised several ways to visualize these gray areas in space—all symbolized with transparent geometry as opposed to solid points. These approximations included using a county’s central point for coordinates or creating rough lines or polygons where an event likely occurred. When drawing conclusions during analysis, I, of course, separated positively-identified coordinates from approximated ones. </span></div>

          </div>
          <div class="w-col w-col-8">
            <div class="paragraph-2">The descriptor combinations listed in the above table are the most common; however, others did exist. For example, on rare occasions, civilians killed other civilians. In this example, the actor is a civilian (civ), the action is lethal violence (lethal), and the civilian acted upon another civilian (civ). In these instances, the classification system’s flexibility encompassed the guerrilla conflict’s variety of violence. Still, the above combinations make up a vast majority of the <em>OMAM</em> database. <br><br>Other situations forced me to make a judgment call between descriptors. One of the hardest things to differentiate was guerrillas’ targets. There is a gray area between guerrillas targeting the Union army and guerrillas targeting civilians because of organized “strong-arm Union bands.” Unionist civilians composed these sometimes-sanctioned, sometimes-extralegal militia units. Historian Michael Fellman described them as “well-led ‘mobs’ … [that] killed and burned out” southern sympathizers and even overthrew “civic governments and circuit courts.” Often, guerrillas targeted such militia units <em>as an extension</em> of the Union army. The problem lies in deciding whether or not to classify members of such groups as the Union army or as a civilian—I chose to categorize situations in this gray area as guerrillas targeting civilians. This decision allows me to silence any accusations of being an apologist for guerrillas’ brutality. Guerrillas also targeted furloughed or discharged soldiers. I categorized these targets as the Union army.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup><br><br>Similarly, it was difficult to distinguish a perpetrator of violence as a guerrilla versus a civilian because guerrilla bands were composed of, and supported by, civilians. They’re one and the same. Sometimes guerrilla bands sustained steady membership and obeyed designated leaders. We know a lot of these guerrillas’ names. Other times, civilians capitalized on the confusion of guerrilla war to wage personal vendettas or loot without actually taking to the bush for an extended period of time. This conundrum is part of guerrillas’ tactics to confuse their opponents; an army cannot destroy an unidentifiable enemy. As such, I relied on the primary document’s language to make this decision. If the Union army or civilians called perpetrators of violence guerrillas, I categorized them as guerrillas. If the Union army or civilians noted acts of violence or property destruction without naming a perpetrator, I categorized the perpetrator as a civilian.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup><br><br>Another difficult choice was whether or not to classify a civilian as comprising part of guerrillas’ domestic supply line. It was often impossible to ascertain civilian’s genuine loyalties. (There is an entire subfield of Civil War history dedicated to this issue.) When guerrillas entered a community, local civilians responded in numerous ways; some were forced to give aid or information, others offered these things freely. Some lied about their true loyalties to ensure their survival; others stood up for their beliefs and paid the ultimate price. Some joined the guerrillas for the day and exacted personal vendettas against their neighbors; others assembled with the local Unionist militia and openly fought guerrillas. Most complied with the wishes of whatever power occupied their community at any given time—be it guerrillas or the Union army—and kept their mouths shut in order to save their family and farms. I chose to only “positively” condemn a civilian for assisting guerrillas if the Union army built a watertight case against a suspected abettor, complete with eyewitness testimony and/or confessions. This decision surely underestimates the number of civilians composing guerrillas’ domestic supply line, but does not exaggerate the guerrilla war’s extent.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup><br></div>

First, I enrolled in one GIS class as a master’s student, but the rest of my knowledge concerning the necessary technology for this project came almost exclusively from YouTube tutorials. Second, all of the grants I won as a graduate student contributed to research trips, meaning I built all of the project websites by myself with no money or proper training.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup> (Excellent open-source software for building websites exists, but we all know free isn’t free—they come with harsh limitations, especially for a historian trying to adapt technology built with a different disciplines’ needs in mind.) <br>‍<br>Below are descriptions of each version of the project, with links to those projects, themselves.<br></div>

            <div class="paragraph-2 section-top"><span class="text-span-2">Version 1.0, built as a master’s student at West Virginia University, was a disaster. I took the Geography Department’s entry-level class on ArcGIS, then ditched that software entirely after realizing its time function was a bit clunky. This was a huge mistake. As I learned years later from the University of Georgia’s GIS Librarian, Meagan Duever, “time is hard.” Truth. I soon learned that <em>no</em> digital mapping platform has a less-than-clunky time function. <br>‍<br>I decided to learn a new piece of software—Neatline, a plug-in for Omeka, which is a “free, flexible, and open source web-publishing platform”—with no training, while simultaneously undergoing the data entry process, a semester before I was slated to defend my thesis, with a broken laptop and no money to replace it.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup><span class="text-span-2"><br>‍<br>To be sure, someone experienced with Neatline and/or Omeka will probably be able to offer easy solutions to the following problems. I am certain most, if not all, of these issues resulted from operator error. Still, this proves my initial point about trying conditions: any history graduate student trying to learn multiple software platforms in addition to their coursework, research, and writing loads will inevitably face similar circumstances. <br>‍<br>A comedy of errors ensued. At the time (2013), Omeka either only ran, or best ran, I can’t remember which, on a Linux operating system. I had no suitable computer, and the WVU geography lab’s computers ran on Windows. Just to access Neatline, I had to alter the boot sequence of the geography lab’s computers to read from their USB port, then booted them from an external hard drive loaded with a Linux operating system (which took me two days to install with help from a local bassist I played music with who happened to have a Computer Science degree). This workaround sufficiently allowed me to pair the geography lab’s computers with Neatline’s necessary operating system, but drastically reduced the computer’s processing speed. As a result, inputting mass quantities of evidence into Neatline became painstakingly slow as the program constantly crashed. <br>‍<br>Then there were the plug-ins. So many plug-ins (Neatline itself being a plug-in). And each plug-in layered another set of limitations on visualizing the project’s data. For example, the ‘CSV Import’ plug-in enabled me to upload data contained in Excel spreadsheets, but utilized Dublin Core standards for data categorization, which seriously hampered my ability to include historical nuance and ambiguity.</span><sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup><span class="text-span-2"> A ‘Neatline Maps’ plug-in was necessary to display useful indicators such as county lines, topographic identifiers, and historical demarcations. Alas, I never did figure out how to wed downloaded shapefiles of historic transportation networks—such as the 1861 railroad system—with this plug-in. Consequently, my analysis suffered (guerrillas frequently attacked the Union army’s logistics network). </span><br></div><img src="images/ProjectHistory_01_Neatline.jpg" srcset="images/ProjectHistory_01_Neatline-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/ProjectHistory_01_Neatline.jpg 674w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 709px) 95vw, (max-width: 767px) 674px, (max-width: 991px) 478.65625px, 619.984375px" alt="" class="inline-image">
            <div class="photo-caption">A screenshot of my MA thesis data displayed in Neatline.</div>
            <div class="paragraph-2"><span>Most importantly, I could not simultaneously view or edit large quantities of inputted information through an attribute table. The data for each event on the map was organized and accessible separately, meaning I had to make sweeping analyses and changes one case at a time (for example, if I wanted to change the symbology for Union occupational forces on the map from a red square to a blue triangle, I had to do so one point at a time, hundreds of times). <br>‍<br>The result of all this? Most embarrassingly, my master’s thesis contains dozens of footnotes with broken links referencing a Neatline project that was never publically-accessible and no longer exists. This is professionally unacceptable and I’ve had to live with that. But I did learn the hard way that ArcGIS—clunky time function and all—was the most powerful spatial analytics program available to me. </span></div>

            <div class="paragraph-2 section-top">Despite its many flaws, I presented this project at multiple academic conferences and word about my spatial methodology and its resulting conclusions confirmed some of the more qualitative arguments coming from my colleagues in the Civil War guerrilla field. Joseph M. Beilein, Jr. and Matthew C. Hulbert approached me about publishing my findings in an upcoming edited collection.<br>‍<br>While the text that became my chapter in Beilein &amp; Hulbert’s <em>Civil War Guerrilla </em>(2015) went through the history profession’s normal peer-review processes, those processes did not (and still do not) exist for digital history projects. Therefore, the publication of partly-textual, partly-digital scholarship brought about an awkward problem: how to cite a changing digital database in non-changing text? Historians <em>must</em> be transparent by showing the source material that led to their conclusions, but this project’s source material was organized in a dynamic database that still didn’t have a home online. <br>‍<br>I opted to convert my project’s Neatline component back into ArcGIS and publish my data in a free website using ArcGIS Online—a cloud-based service for hosting interactive maps (an explanation of how to access that data is described in <em>Version 3.0</em>).<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup> At nearly the same time, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the University of Georgia’s PhD program, where I lucked upon a home for this new, ArcGIS Online website: UGA’s Center for Virtual History. <br>‍<br>The result was less than perfect (from footnotes in my chapter from <em>Civil War Guerrilla</em>): “Citations … [from <em>Version 1.0</em>] refer to material from Neatline databases that are part of my master’s thesis, Fialka, “Reassessing Guerrillas”; the URLs are item identifiers, not publicly accessible website addresses. These materials will be made publically available at … the University of Georgia’s Center for Virtual History[, which] currently hosts an expanding version of the datasets and maps used in this essay.”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup> The “materials” referenced in those footnotes are located at the <em>Version 2.0 </em>link. <br>‍<br>Ultimately, <em>Version </em>2.0 was quick and dirty—its existence rushed by my desire to take advantage of a publication opportunity (a huge boost on the increasingly competitive job market) and to meet my profession’s standards of transparency. I committed myself to building a proper website as soon as possible.<br></div>

First, while the text and static maps reflected conclusions from my dissertation research (mostly conducted in Kentucky), the Interactive Map still only includes information from my master’s thesis. I chose not to rebuild an interactive map until I could do so properly—with grant money to hire Computer Science and GeoScience expertise. <br>‍<br>Second, while the database from my master’s thesis was publically-accessible, actually doing this was still wrought with difficulties. In order to have the database truly available in a user-friendly way, I would have to allow the user to direct download the Excel file where I conduct data entry. I do not want to do this for professional reasons: I am still updating said database and building a career by drawing conclusions from it. As a junior faculty member, I cannot afford to allow a senior faculty member access to my research, as they may be able to publish conclusions from it before I can. Instead, I allow the user to view the database within the Interactive Map’s menu. Directions to do so are displayed in the YouTube tutorial posted on the website.

Hale, <i>Branded as Rebels: A List of Bushwhackers, Guerrillas, Partisan Rangers, Confederates and Southern Sympathizers from Missouri During the War Years.</i> (Lee’s Summit, Missouri, 1995). In addition, Richard Brownlee’s <i>Gray Ghosts of the Confederacy</i> includes an appendix of “known members of Quantrill’s, Anderson’s and Todd’s guerrillas.” The list includes 340 names and when the guerrillas died. See, Richard Brownlee, <i>Gray Ghosts of the Confederacy: Guerrilla Warfare in the West, 1861-1865</i> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1958), 253-261.

          <p>Michael Fellman provides an excellent examination of this phenomenon, which he calls “survival lying.” See Fellman, <i>Inside War</i>, 58, 264, 49-52, 195, 228.

          <p>There are three major exceptions. First, eHistory works closely with David Holcomb of the <i>Information Technology Outreach Services</i> group at the Carl Vinson Institute of the University of Georgia. Because of my association with eHistory, I was able to reach out to David for help on many occasions, especially regarding ArcGIS Online. Second, I hired Brandon Adams—Senior GIS Technician at the University of Georgia’s Center for Geospatial Research—for GIS tutoring using funds from the Horace Montgomery fellowship in 2015. Last, I took a research seminar while at UGA entitled History, Mapping, and Spatial Analysis. While the course represented an eight-week version of the entry-level GIS course I took at WVU, I spent the second eight weeks of the course learning valuable information from the course’s professor: Dr. Sergio Bernardes (also employed with UGA’s Center for Geospatial Research). My sincerest thanks to all these men.
