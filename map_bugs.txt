bugs in map: 
- clickdown should trigger zindex adjustment of boxes, not clickup. 
- page buttons don't start out the right color. looks like the whole titlebar color changed. 
- the cursor changes to a drag icon when over the body of the box, but should only do so when over the box titlebar (it should use mouseover singleton)
- tools still freeze with large datasets
